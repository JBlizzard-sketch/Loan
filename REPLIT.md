Kechita Intelligence Platform - Replit.md

## Vision Statement
Kechita Intelligence Platform (KIP) is an AI-powered operational and analytical system for Kechita Microfinance.
It is designed to automate daily communications, generate financial insights, and offer decision support for loan operations across 100+ branches in Kenya.
The system integrates WhatsApp, Telegram, and a secure web dashboard to provide real-time updates, analytics, and AI-generated insights on collections, disbursements, arrears, and customer engagement.



## Core Objectives
1. Automate creation of WhatsApp and Telegram messages to motivate staff and report KPIs.
2. Generate dynamic analytics on loan data ‚Äî disbursements, collections, arrears, customer activity.
3. Provide AI-powered recommendations for loan limits, client profiles, and portfolio growth.
4. Enable branch and regional tracking with automated performance summaries.
5. Allow seamless handover between Replit instances through this replit.md progress tracker.



## Phase Scope (20-minute sessions / $5 worth of work)
Each Replit agent will autonomously complete realistic milestones worth ~$5 of work (~20 minutes runtime).
At the end of each run, progress must be logged here under the ‚ÄúProgress Log‚Äù section with details on:
- What was built or improved
- Next recommended task
- Dependencies created (files, folders, API keys used)



## Technical Architecture Overview
- **Frontend:** Minimal admin dashboard (React + Tailwind) for analytics and message review.
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) for data ingestion, transformation, and API endpoints.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured loan data, MongoDB for unstructured message logs.
- **AI Engine:** GPT-powered for text generation; fallback to Groq or free models if GPT tokens are unavailable.
- **Bot Layer:** Twilio WhatsApp API + Telegram Bot API for communication with staff and branches.
- **Data Input:** CSV, Excel, or API-based ingestion (manual or automated).
- **Analytics Engine:** Pandas + Scikit-learn + LangChain for parsing, insights, and forecasting.



## Fallback and Continuity Design
- If GPT-5 API is unavailable ‚Üí fallback to Groq or OpenRouter-compatible LLMs.
- If database access fails ‚Üí temporarily use CSV persistence.
- Each session will verify environment integrity and rebuild missing components automatically.
- All progress (file paths, API integrations, datasets) must be logged in this `replit.md` under the ‚ÄúProgress Log‚Äù.



## API Integrations Needed
1. **OpenAI / GPT API Key** ‚Äì for primary AI text and analytics.
2. **Groq API Key (Optional)** ‚Äì fallback LLM when GPT token limits are reached.
3. **Twilio API Keys** ‚Äì for WhatsApp bot via Twilio Sandbox.
4. **Telegram Bot Token** ‚Äì for Telegram bot functionality.
5. **PostgreSQL URI** ‚Äì for main data storage.
6. **MongoDB URI (optional)** ‚Äì for logging and caching message history.
7. **Replit Secrets (Environment Variables)** ‚Äì for securely storing credentials.
